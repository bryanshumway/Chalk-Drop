\begin{abstract}
Drop a piece of chalk at an angle and where will it break? There is a mathmetical model that predicts it will break in the center since it will be hit at the two ends and create half a wavelenggth treating the ends as nodes and the center as an antinode. There are no serious experiments around where the chalk will break though. To test wether this mathmetical model is accurate various heights will be tested to determine if there exist a correlation between the height and the proportion of chalk that remained of the elevated side after the first break by measuring the masses. No correlation has been found between height and breakpoint. Observations of the chalk led to the testing of impact angles and rotational speed to the point at which it breaks.
