\begin{abstract}
Drop a piece of chalk at an angle and where will it break? There is a mathmetical model that predicts it will break in the center but no serious experiments around where it will break. To test wether this mathmetical model is accurate various heights will be tested to determine if there exist a correlation between the height and the proportion of chalk that remained of the elevated side after the first break by measuring the masses.
